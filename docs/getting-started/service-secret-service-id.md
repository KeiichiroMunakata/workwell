## Service Secret / Service ID

Please get in touch with Workwell tech support team to get a `service_id` and a `service_secret` once you register as a Workwell Service.

They will be used to obtain the *service token* (cf next section) that is necessary to use the SDK.

We recommend to store the service_id and service_secret in your back-end for security reason.

Please see Security on how to generate the service token and use that token to try out the .getUserInfo method.

Once your service is finished, please follow Service Authorization / Versioning that allows Workwell to verify your service's authenticity and handles correctly the service version.
