## Bridge with the app

  * ### openWebPage
  
    This function opens a new page with Workwell's native way (instead of opening it in the same browser's web view). It's for     a better UI / UX.

    **Parameters**

    -   `url` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the url to     navigate to
    
    **Example**
    
    ```javascript
    Workwell.openWebPage(window.location.href + "/my-page");
    ```
